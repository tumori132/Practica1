s = ' NumPy is the fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python.\n\n    Website: https://www.numpy.org\n    Documentation: https://numpy.org/doc\n    Mailing list: https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion\n    Source code: https://github.com/numpy/numpy\n    Contributing: https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html\n    Bug reports: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues\n    Report a security vulnerability: https://tidelift.com/docs/security\n\nIt provides:\n\n    a powerful N-dimensional array object\n    sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n    tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n    useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\n\nTesting:\n\n    NumPy versions ≥ 1.15 require pytest\n    NumPy versions < 1.15 require nose\n\nTests can then be run after installation with:\n\npython -c \'import numpy; numpy.test()\'\n\nCall for Contributions\n\nThe NumPy project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm!\n\nSmall improvements or fixes are always appreciated; issues labeled as "good first issue" may be a good starting point. If you are considering larger contributions to the source code, please contact us through the mailing list first.\n\nWriting code isn’t the only way to contribute to NumPy. You can also:\n\n    review pull requests\n    triage issues\n    develop tutorials, presentations, and other educational materials\n    maintain and improve our website\n    develop graphic design for our brand assets and promotional materials\n    translate website content\n    help with outreach and onboard new contributors\n    write grant proposals and help with other fundraising efforts\n\nIf you’re unsure where to start or how your skills fit in, reach out! You can ask on the mailing list or here, on GitHub, by opening a new issue or leaving a comment on a relevant issue that is already open.\n\nOur preferred channels of communication are all public, but if you’d like to speak to us in private first, contact our community coordinators at numpy-team@googlegroups.com or on Slack (write numpy-team@googlegroups.com for an invite).\n\nWe also have a biweekly community call, details of which are announced on the mailing list. You are very welcome to join.\n\nIf you are new to contributing to open source, this guide helps explain why, what, and how to successfully get involved.\n\nPowered by NumFOCUS\nAbout\n\nThe fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.\nnumpy.org\nTopics\npython numpy\nResources\nReadme\nLicense\nBSD-3-Clause License\nReleases 183\nv1.20.1 Latest\non 7 Feb\n+ 182 releases\nSponsor this project\n\n    @numfocus\n    numfocus NumFOCUS \n\n    tidelift tidelift.com/funding/github/pypi/numpy\n\n    https://numpy.org/about/\n\nLearn more about GitHub Sponsors\nPackages\nNo packages published\nUsed by 617k\n\n    @sktatsuno\n    @Andy-CH-BO-AN\n    @sinablk\n    @bartmch\n    @dydwkd486\n    @mochibbb\n    @ishujais\n    @khoa-luan\n\n+ 617,044\nContributors 1,083\n\n    @charris\n    @teoliphant\n    @mattip\n    @cournape\n    @eric-wieser\n    @seberg\n    @pearu\n    @rgommers\n    @pv\n    @juliantaylor\n    @mwiebe\n\n+ 1,072 contributors\nLanguages\n\nPython 63.4%\nC 35.3%\nC++ 1.0%\nJavaScript 0.1%\nFortran 0.1%\nShell 0.1%'
